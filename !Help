                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The use of Collision should be fairly self explanatory. The screens are split into three levels, early, middle and upper.

If you wish the Edit level... and Choices... menu items to be unselectable to prevent children fiddling, then shift double click on !Collision, then shift double click on the !Run file. Change the last line from
Run <Collision$Dir>.!RunImage
to
Run <Collision$Dir>.!RunImage -noconfig
