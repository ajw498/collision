Can you draw a line from the bottom of the screen to the pale blue target at the top without hitting the edge or the coloured shapes?  To draw the line you must give an order to tell the arrow how to move.  Type F1 for forward 1 dot (F2=forward 2 dots etc.)  To turn a right angled corner type L for left and R for right.  After each order press RETURN to go onto the next order.  Use the arrow keys to move up and down between orders.  When your program is ready, you can click on the RUN button.  You can try again if you crash into a shape or do not hit the target.  If you want to start your program again then use the mouse to click on the CLEAR button.
