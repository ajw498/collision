Can you draw a line from the bottom of the screen to the pale blue target at the top without hitting the edge or the coloured shapes?  To draw the line you must give an order to tell the arrow how to move.  Type F1 for forward 1 dot (F2=forward 2 dots etc.)  To turn a right angled corner type L for left and R for right.  After each order press RETURN to let the arrow follow your order and then you can start a new order.  You can try again if you crash into a shape or do not hit the target.  If you want to start your program again then use the mouse to click on the CLEAR button.
