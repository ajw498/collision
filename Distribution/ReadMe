These programs are Shareware, see the manual for more details.

They have been tested on RISC OS 3.11 and 3.71, but do not come with any kind of warranty, i.e. they are supplied "as is" and I am not responsible if they do not work correctly. However I will try to correct any bugs that are found.

The manual is in three different formats - Easiwriter/Techwriter, HTML, and plain text. The content is the same for all of them, but the plain text one looses all the formatting. If you print from the Easiwriter/Techwriter one then it will create an A5 pamplet (2 sheets of A4).

Any comments, bug reports or suggestions for improvements are welcome. You can e-mail me, Alex Waugh, at ajw498@ecs.soton.ac.uk
