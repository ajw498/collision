Can you draw a line from the white square at the bottom to the pale blue one at the top without hitting the coloured shapes?

To draw the line you must tell the arrow how to move.

Type F1 for forward 1 dot, (F2=forward 2 dots etc.)

To turn a right angled corner type R90 or L90.

To turn a half right angled corner type R45 or L45.

You could also turn 135° or 180° if you need.

F is followed by a number.  R and L are followed by 45, 90, 135 or 180

After each order press RETURN to start a new order.

Type RUN (and RETURN) when you want the arrow to start.

You may edit your program if it didn't work.  Select the line you want to
change, then press delete and enter your new instruction (and then RETURN).
