Can you draw a line from the white square at the bottom to the pale blue
one at the top without hitting the coloured shapes?

To draw the line you must tell the arrow how to move.

Type F1 for forward 1 dot, (F2=forward 2 dots etc.)

To turn a right angled corner type R or L.

F is followed by a number.

After each order press RETURN to start a new order.

Type RUN (and RETURN) when you want the arrow to start.

You may edit your program if it didn't work.  Select the line you want to
change, then press delete and enter your new instruction (and then RETURN).
