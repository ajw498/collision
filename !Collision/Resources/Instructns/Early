Can you draw a line from the white square at the bottom to the pale blue
one at the top without hitting the coloured shapes?

To draw the line you must tell the arrow how to move.

Type f1 for forward 1 dot, (f2=forward 2 dots etc.)

To turn a corner type l for left and r for right.

After each order press RETURN to start a new order.

You can try again if you crash into a shape or do not hit the target.

If you made a mistake and did not crash then you can type undo (and RETURN)
and the arrow will undo the last move you made.
