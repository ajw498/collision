This is Edit, version 1.00 (20-Dec-88)

Documentation on how to use Edit can be found in Edition 2 of the Archimedes
User Guide.

The following remarks should be noted about this version of Edit and its
documentation.

The TAB key can be used to move the caret along the line to the column
position that matches the start of the next word boundary on the line above,
provided that the 'line above' is not wrapped.

When forming a selection using the SELECT and ADJUST mouse keys, if CTRL is
held down, the caret will not be moved. This makes it easier to copy a block
of text to where the caret already is: hold down CTRL, make the selection,
type C, release CTRL.

ADJUST on the close box of an Edit window will close the window (if the
window is not modified) and open the parent directory viewer. This should be
thought of as similar to ADJUST on the close box of a directory viewer.

The vertical scroll bar indicates the fraction of the file currently visible
as a fraction of the total number of characters, rather than as a fraction of
the number of lines.  This means that the length of the vertical scroll bar
will vary dependent upon the number of characters in the window.

If a desktop closedown sequence (e.g. Exit from the Task manager menu)
occurs when Edit has some modified buffers, Edit sometimes erroneously
terminates the desktop closedown sequence. It is of course normal practice
to save your work before trying to exit the desktop.
